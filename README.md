# DiamondAnalysis
Final project in Stat 321, applied linear regression. Goal is to apply what we have learned on analyzing data to a data set of our choosing.

-	Use a data set that is appropriate for model building using regression techniques.  
-	Building a model on a random sample of half of the observations in the data set.
-	Using the model to predict the other half of the data set.
-	Writing up the results of your work, and your analysis.
